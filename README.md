# PM Chart Tester 

A web-based game to see if you can fill out the *PMBOK&reg; 6 Guide* process group chart from memory.  Useful as a study aid for the PMP&reg; 
certification exam.

This project is 100% non-commercial, and is strictly something I used to help myself study which seemed it could be useful to other students.
